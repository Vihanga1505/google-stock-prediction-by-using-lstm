## What is LSTM?
LSTM (short for Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Unlike traditional RNNs, which can suffer from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, LSTM networks use gated cells to selectively retain or forget information at each time step, allowing them to remember important information over longer periods of time.

## How can we use LSTM in Stock Price Prediction?
Using LSTM for stock price prediction requires a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model creation, training, and evaluation. It's important to remember that stock price prediction is a challenging task, and the accuracy of the model depends on various factors such as the quality of the data, the features used, and the model architecture. Following steps are being followed for model creation and Value prediction. 

1.Data Preparation: The first step is to collect the historical data of the stock prices that you want to predict. The data should be preprocessed, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.

2.Feature Engineering: After the data is prepared, you need to extract relevant features that can help the model learn patterns and make accurate predictions. Some common features used in stock price prediction include moving averages, technical indicators, and economic indicators.

3.LSTM Model Creation: The next step is to create an LSTM model that can predict stock prices. The model consists of input layer, LSTM layer(s), and output layer. You can experiment with different architectures, such as the number of LSTM layers, number of neurons in each layer, and activation functions.

4.Model Training: Once the model is created, it needs to be trained on the training data. The model learns the patterns in the data and adjusts its parameters to minimize the loss function.

5.Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on the testing data to check its performance. You can use metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance.

6.Predictions: Finally, the model can be used to make predictions on new data. You can use the model to predict future stock prices based on the historical data.
